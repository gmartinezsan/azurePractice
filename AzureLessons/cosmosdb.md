# Cosmos DB Trigger & Bindings

## Goal üéØ

The goal of this lesson is to learn how to trigger a function by adding a document to CosmosDB, and how you can use input and output bindings for CosmosDB documents.

This lessons consists of the following exercises:

|Nr|Exercise
|-|-
|1|Running the Azure CosmosDB Emulator
|2|Using the CosmosDB output binding
|3|Using the CosmosDB input binding
|4|Creating a CosmosDB Trigger function
|5|Using Azure KeyVault for storing the connectionstring
|6|Reusing the CosmosDB connection with dependency injection
|7|Deploying to Azure

> üìù **Tip** - If you're stuck at any point you can have a look at the [source code](../src) in this repository
